# VMSC-Project

The Veterans And Military Success Center (VMSC) at Purdue serves the veteran and military-affiliated population of Purdue, Purdue Indianapolis, and Purdue Online. Among other roles, the VMSC holds social, administrative, and career events such as a highly-popular Military Appreciation Tailgate, events with companies like Lockheed Martin, and workshops for its students.
This project focuses on building a dashboard of event attendance and kiosk scan data from their office, allowing the VMSC to understand the success of their events and enabling better planning for the future.
